# 2. Almost Hangman

# Write a program to recognize a text symbol

# The user (first player) enters the text.

# Only asterisks instead of letters are output.

# Assume that there are no numbers, but there may be spaces.

# The user (i.e. the other player) enters the symbol.

# If the letter is found, then the letter is displayed in ALL the appropriate places, all other letters remain asterisks.

# Example:

# First input: KartupeÄ¼u lauks -> ********* *****

# Second input: a -> *a****** *a***




# In principle, this is a good start to the game of hangman.
