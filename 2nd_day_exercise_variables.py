# Write a program that asks for and saves a username
# Ask a question about the user's age, using the username in the question.
# Shows in how many years the user will be 100 years old smile
# BONUS: 
# then you will need two additional lines:
# import datetime # let's talk about imports separately
# currentYear = datetime.datetime.now (). yearLet the program also show the year when the user will be 100 years old.
# It could use a variable with the current year.
# It would be even better to get the current year automatically
username = input("What is your username? ")
print("How old are you " + username + "? ")
age = input("How old are you " + username + "? ")
years_until_100 = int(100) - age
print("You will be hundred years old in " + years_until_100 + " ğŸ™‚")
